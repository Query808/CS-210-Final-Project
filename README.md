# CS-210-Final-Project
Created a program in order to sort products for a Grocery store. Could have added more redundancy. This would make the program better for the end user. I found aligning the histogram to be the most challenging. I recommend utilizing zybooks for finding new ways to improve the code, I used it significantly during it's creation. I think that the groundwork this code lays for comparing text inputs would be useful in a wide variety of programs. I tried to regularly utilize inline comments to keep this program maintainable for other coders.
